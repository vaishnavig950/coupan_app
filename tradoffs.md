# Trade-offs and Scalability Challenges
## Trade-offs

- In-Memory Storage:

  - Pros: Simplifies development and testing; offers fast read and write access to coupon data.
  - Cons: Data is not persistent, which means all coupon configurations and usage counts are lost when the application restarts. This makes it unsuitable for production environments without a proper database backing.
<br>
- Synchronous Processing:

  - Pros: Simplicity in implementation; easy to reason about the flow of coupon validation and application.
  - Cons: In a high-concurrency environment, this approach may lead to race conditions where multiple users can apply the same coupon simultaneously, potentially violating usage limits.
<br>
- Single-Threaded Logic:

  - Pros: Easier to manage and test; avoids complications of multi-threading.
  - Cons: Limits the applicationâ€™s ability to handle high traffic, especially if multiple requests to apply the same coupon are made concurrently.
<br>
- Hardcoded Limits:

  - Pros: Simplifies the configuration process; easier for initial deployment.
  - Cons: Lack of flexibility to adjust limits dynamically based on user behavior or market trends without code changes.
<br>
- Limited Error Handling:

  - Pros: Reduces complexity in the codebase; makes the initial implementation faster.
  - Cons: This may lead to unclear failure states or unhandled exceptions in production, affecting user experience.

## Scalability Challenges

- Data Persistence:
Without a robust database, all data is lost on application restart. A switch to a persistent storage solution (e.g., SQL or NoSQL database) is essential for a production-grade service.
<br>
- Concurrency Management:
The current implementation does not account for concurrent modifications. As user traffic grows, this could lead to incorrect application of coupons and violations of usage limits. Implementing locking mechanisms or using database transactions would help manage this.
<br>
- Load Balancing:
In a distributed environment, maintaining - Consistent state across multiple instances of the service could be challenging. A centralized data store or distributed cache (e.g., Redis) would be necessary to synchronize state.
<br>
- Dynamic Configuration:
As the number of coupons and user interactions increases, the need for dynamic configuration of limits becomes important. This may require a user-friendly admin interface and backend changes to allow real-time updates to coupon configurations.
<br>
- Monitoring and Analytics:
As usage scales, tracking coupon performance (e.g., redemption rates, fraud detection) becomes crucial. Implementing analytics will require additional infrastructure and design - Considerations to handle the volume of data generated.
<br>
- Performance Optimization:
With an increase in users, the service may face performance bottlenecks. Profiling and optimizing the service, possibly incorporating caching strategies for frequently accessed data, will be necessary to maintain responsiveness.
