# Additional Tests for Coupon Service

If I had more time, I would consider adding the following tests to ensure comprehensive coverage and robustness of the coupon service:

1. **Validation of Coupon Details**:
  Test that adding a coupon with invalid data (e.g., negative limits or missing fields) throws the appropriate errors.

2. **Handling Invalid Coupon Codes**:
  Test that applying a coupon with an invalid format (e.g., special characters, too short, etc.) is rejected with a suitable message.

3. **Global Limit Edge Cases**:
  Test the scenario where the global limit is set to a very high number and multiple users attempt to apply the coupon simultaneously, ensuring that the correct limits are enforced.

4. **User ID Uniqueness**:
  Test to verify that the same user cannot apply a coupon multiple times in a single transaction (e.g., attempting to apply the same coupon in parallel requests).

5. **Coupon Expiration**:
  Add tests to verify that expired coupons are not valid and return the appropriate message.

6. **Coupon Status After Application**:
  Check that the coupon status (e.g., number of times applied) updates correctly after each application.

7. **Concurrency Handling**:
  Simulate concurrent applications of the same coupon from multiple users to ensure that race conditions are handled properly.

8. **Resets After Limits Reached**:
  Verify that the limits reset correctly after reaching the respective thresholds, especially focusing on the transition from one period to another (daily/weekly).

9. **Different User Behavior**:
  Test for edge cases where different users apply the same coupon simultaneously, ensuring that the service tracks each userâ€™s limit independently.

10.  **Coupon Revocation**:
  Implement and test the ability to revoke a coupon and ensure that it cannot be applied afterward.

11.  **Multiple Coupons Application**:
  Test scenarios where multiple different coupons are applied in a single transaction, checking that limits for each coupon are correctly enforced.

12.  **Logging and Auditing**:
  Check that actions like coupon applications, failures, and resets are logged appropriately for future audits.

13.  **User-Based Limits Across Multiple Coupons**:
  Ensure that user limits are correctly applied when multiple coupons with user-based restrictions are applied.

By implementing these tests, you would have a more comprehensive suite that can handle a wider array of scenarios, ensuring the coupon service is robust and reliable under various conditions.
